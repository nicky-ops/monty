# 0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO
* A variable is declared when the compiler is informed that a variable exists (and this is its type); it does not allocate the storage for the variable at that point.
* A variable is defined when the compiler allocates the storage for the variable.
* A stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO(Last in fisrts out) rule. Both insertion and deletion takes place from one end. A stack can be implemented in two ways:
1. Statically: allows the static memory alocation of its data elements. The stack inherits all the characteristics of an array.
2. Dynamically: dynamic memoty allocation of its data elements. The stack inherits all the characterisitics of a linked list.
